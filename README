This is a joint effort between the Attie Lab at University of Wisconsin Madison (http://www.biochem.wisc.edu/faculty/attie/lab/) the Baliga Lab (http://baliga.systemsbiology.net) and the Shmulevich Lab (http://shmulevich.systemsbiology.net/).  Incorporating the cirvis technology from the Shmulevich lab as a visualization for trans-eQTL results from a mouse F2 intercross.

Data is stored as JSON formatted flat files and is selectively loaded based upon user input as to the trans-eQTL hotspot they wish to view.

Dependencies:

Apache
JQuery
Circvis
mod_python

Installing mod_python into the Apache web server:

Ensure you have an Apache web server and mod_python installed on the server you are trying to install this software.  Then add the folllowing lines to the Apache httpd.conf file:

  LoadModule python_module modules/mod_python.so

  # Python pycircvis directory
  <Directory /path/to/where/you/put/this/software> 
      AddHandler mod_python .py
      PythonHandler mod_python.publisher
      PythonDebug On 
  </Directory>

Restart the Apache web server and check to see if you path you setup the software serves up the data:
